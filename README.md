- Untitled11.py : This script is for inference detection using custom trained Fast RCNN, EfficientDet, and SSDMobilenet models.

- untitled13.py : This script is for inference detection using custom trained Mask RCNN models (i.e. the segmentation models).

- untitles12.py : This script is for inference detection using models such as Fast RCNN, EfficientDet, Mask RCNN and SSDMobilenet models which are pretrained on the Microsoft COCO datatset.

- YoloV3.ipynb : This python notebook is for running inference using a YoloV3 model which makes use of COCO pre-trained weights.  

- untitled17.py : This script is for detecting the edges of the water surface using canny edge detection algorithm and then it determines the depth of the water using the aspect ratio concept.
